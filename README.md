# Coding-Tweets-with-GPT
This notebook showcases the main steps involved in a current project, where we use GPT-4.o to label Tweets by the Trump &amp; Biden using the best-performing prompt (as determined in previous steps engaging in prompt engineering), that frame the political out-group as immoral, and calculates final performance metrics compared to three human coders. This project is a work-in-progress, future notebooks include the steps & improvements made in prompt engineering itself, other variables, data preparation, etc.
